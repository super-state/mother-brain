# 🧠 Mother Brain

**Vision-Driven Project Framework**

This directory contains all Mother Brain framework files for managing your project through vision-driven development.

## What's Inside

```
.mother-brain/
├── README.md (this file)        # Framework documentation
├── docs/
│   ├── vision.md                # Project vision and strategy
│   ├── roadmap.md               # Phased execution plan

```

## How It Works

Mother Brain operates as an **isolated guest** in your project:
- ✅ Your project files remain untouched (README.md, src/, tests/, etc.)
- ✅ All framework files contained in this directory
- ✅ Easy to add to existing projects (just copy `.mother-brain/`)
- ✅ Easy to remove (delete this directory)

## Usage

Invoke Mother Brain to:
- Continue working on your project
- Review vision and roadmap
- Execute tasks with skill automation
- Track progress across sessions
- Report issues and improvements

## Architecture

This is an **isolated architecture** where Mother Brain manages your project without disrupting your existing files. Think of it as a development companion that lives in its own space.
