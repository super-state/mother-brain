# Example Session Flow

## New Project

```
User: I want to build a music marketing SaaS platform

Mother Brain:
🧠 Welcome to Mother Brain!

[Runs vision discovery wizard - 8-12 questions]

Creates:
- docs/vision.md
- docs/roadmap.md (3 phases identified)
- README.md

Identifies repetitive patterns:
- Spotify API integration
- Image uploads
- User authentication
- Email campaigns

Recommends creating skills:
- spotify-api-integrator
- image-upload-handler
- auth-manager

User agrees, Mother Brain invokes skill-creator 3 times.

First task created: "Set up project structure and authentication"

User: "Start the task"

[Mother Brain uses auth-manager skill, creates deliverables]

Mother Brain: "✅ Task complete! User login system created.
Please test: [instructions]
Does it work properly?"

User: "Yes, looks good!"

Mother Brain marks task complete, asks about next task.
