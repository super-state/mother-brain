# Example Input: Music Marketing SaaS Platform

**User Statement**: "I want to build a music marketing SaaS platform"

## Vision Discovery Wizard Interaction

**Question 1**: What pain point or opportunity are you addressing?
> User: "Independent artists struggle to market their music effectively. They don't have the budget for marketing agencies, and existing tools are either too expensive or too complicated. I want to make professional music marketing accessible to everyone."

**Question 2**: Imagine this project succeeds—what does that look like in 3-12 months?
> User: "In 12 months, 1,000 independent artists are using the platform monthly to run their marketing campaigns. They're seeing measurable increases in streams and followers. The platform handles Spotify playlist pitching, social media scheduling, and email campaigns all in one place."

**Question 3**: Who will benefit from this? Describe them.
> User: "Independent artists and small labels. Ages 18-35, tech-savvy but not developers. They're releasing music regularly but don't have time or knowledge for marketing."

**Question 4**: Why is this important? What changes if you DON'T build this?
> User: "Great music goes unheard. Artists give up because they can't get traction. The music industry stays dominated by those who can afford expensive marketing."

**Question 5**: How will you know this project succeeded?
> User: "User metrics: 1,000 active users, 50% retention rate. Business metrics: Artists see 20%+ increase in streams. Personal metric: Artists telling me this changed their career."

**Question 6**: What's your timeline?
> User: "6 months to MVP, 12 months to 1,000 users, ongoing after that"

**Question 7**: What limitations exist?
> User: "Budget: $5k for initial hosting/APIs. Skills: I can code backend/frontend but need to learn Spotify API. Time: 20 hours/week."

**Question 8**: What's the minimum that proves this works?
> User: "MVP: Connect Spotify account, submit track to 5 curated playlists, see submission status. If 10 artists use it and get one playlist placement, that proves it works."
