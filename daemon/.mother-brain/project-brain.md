# Mother Brain Daemon — Project Brain

> Project-specific learnings, preferences, and skill tracking.
> Managed by Child Brain. Read by Mother Brain at task start.

## Skills Created
- `daemon-architect` — Architecture patterns, module structure, coding conventions
- `telegram-integrator` — grammy bot, commands, notifications, morning reports
- `verification-engine` — Multi-layer verification gates, confidence classification

## Skills Pending
- `ollama-manager` — Local model lifecycle on Pi, model selection, context optimization (needed for post-MVP local inference)
- `budget-tracker` — Token/cost tracking skill, budget enforcement patterns (needed when implementing budget module)
- `dashboard-builder` — Minimal web UI for configuration and monitoring (post-MVP)
- `morning-report-formatter` — Detailed morning report generation with evidence (may merge into telegram-integrator)

## Style & Preferences
- Quality-first approach — "getting it right the first time"
- Reliability over speed — complexity that risks breaking autonomous operation gets deprioritized
- Token efficiency is sacred — every LLM call must be justified
- Build for ourselves — not optimizing for external users

## Course Corrections
(None yet — project just started)

## Validation Checks
(None yet — will accumulate from task execution feedback)
