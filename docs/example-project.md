# Example Project (3 Steps)

## Example: Simple CLI Tool

**Vision**: Build a CLI that renames files based on a pattern (e.g., `IMG_*.jpg` → `2026-02-05_001.jpg`).

### Step 1: Invoke Mother Brain

```bash
gh copilot explain "Use the mother-brain skill"
```

### Step 2: Answer Vision Questions (Sample)

- Problem: Manual renaming is slow and error-prone
- Users: Developers and photographers
- Success: Rename 100 files in one command without mistakes
- MVP: CLI accepts a pattern, preview, and confirm rename

### Step 3: Run Your First Task

Mother Brain will create:
- A vision document
- A roadmap
- Task 001 with step-by-step guidance

Select "Start Task 001 now" and follow the prompts.
