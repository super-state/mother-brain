# Outcome Demo Template (Interactive + Sign-Off)

Use this template whenever an outcome is ready for user validation.

Goals:
- The user must see something interactive that they did not have before.
- Mother Brain launches the experience (no "run this command" instructions).
- The user signs off on acceptance criteria before moving on.

Template:

📋 Outcome Demo: [Ability to do X]

What you should see:
- [Visible capability 1]
- [Visible capability 2]

I’m opening it for you now:
- [What will open: browser/app/window]
- [Where it should land: URL/route/page]

How to verify (quick path):
- Step 1: [Click/Action]
- Step 2: [Click/Action]
- Expected: [What should happen]

Then validate each acceptance criterion (Yes/No).

Rules:
- If login/authorization/setup requires user action, guide them step-by-step.
- If auto-launch fails, provide one fallback method and then clear manual steps with full paths/URLs.
